# Assessment 4

**READ THIS DOCUMENT COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING THE ASSESSMENT**

## Overview
Now that **Ali Snobba** has a stellar back end thanks to your work, they have asked Cognizant to help create the UI.

The product search API you created in Assessment 2 needs an Angular front end.

## Your Task
- Finish this partially done Angular application so that the current tests pass.  Angular routing has been established, but there is only the redirect route in the app-routing module.
- Finish the application so that it consumes the ProductSearch API and feeds the template in the ProductSearch Component.

## Time to Complete
- You have 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete this assessment.  (Ends at 5pm.)
- Once you are done, you have completed the S2 FSD training!!

## Stories
- As a customer, I can filter search results by brand.
- As a customer, I can filter search results by color.
- As a customer, I can filter search results by price range.
- As a customer, I can combine multiple filters.

## Implementation
- Create an Angular Class that has the same shape as the test data
coming from the ProductSearch API.
- Create an Angular Service that consumes the API.
- Inject this service into the ProductSearch Component and use it to filter and display the items according to the user's search criteria.
